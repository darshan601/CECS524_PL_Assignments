Write a program Find that searches all files specified on the command line and prints out all lines
containing a reserved word. Start a new thread for each file. For example, if you call
java Find Buff report.txt address.txt Homework.java

then the program might print

report.txt: Buffet style lunch will be available at the
address.txt: Buffet, Warren|11801 Trenton Court|Dallas|TX
Homework.java: BufferedReader in;
address.txt: Walters, Winnie|59 Timothy Circle|Buffalo|MI

“Buff” and run for 40 chars more or until EOL.
