1. Write, in the programming language of your choice, an interpreter for Brainfu*k. It is very
simple, on the order of a late first semester of programming assignment. Did mine in Java, about
60 lines of code. Run it with this input below - what is the output?
++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.
+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.

There are two separate Dropboxes, one for each written assignment. For problem 1, turn in your source
code and a screen shoot of the output and the IDE behind it (or surrounding the output). For problem 2,
turn in a Word, PDF or text file.
